## ü§î Philosophy

After working with so many different design frameworks, the same problem always arose time after time. We spend too much time overwriting and fighting against the design framework in order to get it looking just the way we want. _We just want to make the web pretty and not worry about all the small details to get a component working._

This library:

- is ultra-minimalistic
  - by default, no styles are exported, but an example is provided to get you started
- functions with minimal setup
- has accessibility built-in (structure / functionality)
  - styling related accessibility is up to you
- is composable to the allow flexibility
- **for the front-end developers that want to focus on that pixel-perfect design**
